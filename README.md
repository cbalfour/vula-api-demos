Vula/Sakai API Demos
====================

[Vula](https://vula.uct.ac.za) is the [University of Cape
Town](http://www.uct.ac.za)'s instance of the
[Sakai](https://www.sakaiproject.org) Learning Management System (LMS).

This project will (hopefully, eventually) contain example code that
demonstrates the basics of using the various Sakai API's to interact
with Vula.

Most of the code is/will probably be written in
[Python](https://www.python.org) version 3 using the
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework where necessary.
